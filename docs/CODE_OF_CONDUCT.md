- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members
- Helping others learn and improve

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks

- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Violence, threats of violence, or violent language directed against another person
- Conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior. They will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to:

- Remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct
- Temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful

## Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project maintainers. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

Project maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces (repositories, issue trackers, discussions, etc.) and also applies when an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces.
